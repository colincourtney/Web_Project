Most of my time is dedicated to school, but when I do have free time, 
I spend most of it browsing the Internet, going to the gym, or playing 
videogames. One of my favorite things to do is watch videos on YouTube, 
ranging from reviews of the newest supercars to theoretical videos on space. 
It has been interesting to watch how YouTube, and the Internet as a whole, 
has evolved over the years. I am also interested in the stock market, and 
I am majoring in Finance. I spend a lot of my time researching the stock 
market to learn more about it, and I have several simulated portfolios that 
I mess around with, and one real portfolio with a couple hundred dollars 
invested in a range of stocks.
