	<h1>Biography</h1>
	<h3>I was born in Berkeley, California in 1999. When I was 8, we moved from there to Atlanta, Georgia because my mother got a job at the CDC. I attended a public school called Fernbank Elementary for three years, then attended middle school at a private school called The Paideia School. For high school I transferred back to the public school system and attended Chamblee Charter High School in the Magnet Program for High Achievers. During high school, my passion for business, and more specifically the stock market, began to grow a lot and I decided I wanted to major in Finance in college. In the fall of 2017, I began my tenure at the University of Georgia as an Intended Finance major, and that's where I stand today.</h3>
